## Before you start
As you know, tonight's assignment is all about arrays! We covered a lot in class, but you'll have to read the docs for a few more array methods. Also, please see the `ref-examples/` for some examples and graphics about "pass by value" and "pass by reference."

Also, remember that in "Functional Programming" a pure function is one that:

- always gives the same outputs given the same inputs
- has no side effects

A side effect is something like altering global state or mutating an argument. Now that we actually have a data type that can be mutated (arrays), we have to be on the watchout for this! Only mutate when you mean to, and make copies or new arrays for all others!

## Question 1: addToFrontOrBack() - SIDE EFFECTS
Write a function `addToFrontOrBack()` that takes 3 args: an array `arr`, a value of any type `value`, and a boolean `isFront`. Insert the `value` as either the first or last value in the `arr`, depending on the boolean `isFront`. The function should mutate the array and return nothing.

## Question 2: reverseString() - PURE
Write a function `reverseString()` that takes a `string` argument. The function should return a reversed version of the `string`. Will this function modify the original string in any way? Food for thought.

Before you go crazy with loops or anything, check out these three methods which can be combined to reverse a string:
 - [`String.split()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)
 - [`Array.reverse()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse)
 - [`Array.join()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join)

Now, if you want to *manually* do this with loops, go crazy! It's fun, but know there's a common way to do this.

## Question 3: newArrayFullOf() - PURE
Write a function `newArrayFullOf()` that takes 2 args: a value of any type `value` and a number `numOfValue`. Your function should return a new array full of the value. Like this:

```js
const arr = newArrayFullOf(1, 5)
// [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

const arr2 = newArrayFullOf(true, 2)
// [true, true]
```

This might be a stumper, but try experimenting with `new Array()` and perhaps some sort of a *fill* method? HmmmmMMMMmmm?.

This is a cool trick to know, I can't wait till you learn it too!

## Question 4: insertIntoMiddle() - SIDE EFFECT
Write a function `insertIntoMiddle()` that takes 2 args: an array `arr` and a value of any type `value`. The function should find the middle index of the array and then insert the value there. The function is mutational so it returns nothing.

Check the tests to see exactly which index should be the "middle." Don't overthink it!

## Question 5: deleteFromMiddle() - SIDE EFFECT
Write a function `deleteFromMiddle()` that takes an array `arr`. The function should delete whatever value is in the middle index of the array. The function is mutational so it returns nothing.

Check the tests to see exactly which index should be the "middle." Don't overthink it!

## Question 6: isRightIndex - PURE
Write a function `isRightIndex` that takes 3 args: an array `arr`, a primitive type `value`, and a number `index`. The function returns a boolean, `true` if the given `value` is at the `index` in the `arr`, and `false` otherwise. That includes `false` for values that aren't even *in* the array.

## Question 7: roundAllNumsDown - PURE
Write a function `roundAllNumsDown()` that takes an array of numbers `arr`. This function should return a new array full of `arr`s numbers rounded down. The original `arr` numbers should not be modified in any way.

## Question 8: getAllYCoordinates - PURE
Write a function `getAllYCoordinates()` that takes an array of coordinate pairs `arrOfCoords`. This function should return a *new* array full of only the `y` coordinates (that is the *second* value in the coordinate arrays). Like this:

```js
// [x, y]
getAllYCoordinates([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
// [2, 4, 6]

// [x, y, z]
getAllYCoordinates([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
// [2, 5, 8]
```

This is *technically* a matrix function. How about that? You've barely started Marcy, and you're already parsing matrices? I'd be pretty proud of myself if I were you.

## Question 9: MODIFY - uppercaseAll
We have a function in `modify.js` that takes 3 words, upper cases them, and then returns them in an array. However...it's static. What if I pass in 2 words? Or 5? None? All it works with right now is 3 exactly. You should read [the docs for the rest operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) to improve this function.

Remember, we will never pass in an array as an argument, only individual word arguments.

## Question 10: MODIFY - destructureCoordinates
We have a function in `modify.js` that takes a single coordinate array (`[x,y]`) and then returns a template string with them in it. It's not using modern `destructuring` syntax though and that's lame. Modify this function to use destructuring **but keep the variable names x and y**. Our tests are *explicitly* looking for those, and I want you to get the points.

## Question 11: DEBUG - clearArr
In `debug.js` we have a broken function `clearArr()`. It's supposed to mutate a given array by deleting all the the values inside of it. But it's not working. Can you fix it and pass the tests?

## Question 12: DEBUG - getFirstItem
In `debug.js` we have another broken function `getFirstItem()` that is *not* supposed to mutate the given array. We just want the first item of the array. Can you fix it?

## Bonus: Really understand pass by value/reference
We've been passing references and values throughout this assignment, but do you really understand the concept? We'll talk about it again throughout this module, but if you're done, check out the `ref-examples/` directory. There's some graphics and example code in there. Play around with them!

A question to grapple with is this:

```js

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const arr2 = [5, 6, 7, 8];
const bigArr1 = [arr1, arr2];
const bigArr2 = [...bigArr1];
arr1.push('oh dear');

console.log(bigArr1)
console.log(bigArr2)
```

What does that log and why? We've talked about copying arrays, but called them "shallow" copies. Why?

"Pass by Reference" and "Pass by Value" are weird concepts for some, but once you get them (and you all will), a paradigm shift occurs in your brain. You'll start to see data types and functions differently. It's cool, we can't wait!
